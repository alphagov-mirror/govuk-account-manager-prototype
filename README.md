# Set up the GOV.UK account manager prototype

The GOV.UK account manager prototype is an application to test how users:

- authenticate their data
- authorise their data for exchange
- stay informed of the use of their data
- manage consent for use of their data

This content tells you how to:

- set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype
- integrate the `finder-frontend` Brexit transition checker with the GOV.UK account manager

This content is for GOV.UK developers working on Macs or Linux. If you are not a GOV.UK developer, you cannot use this prototype.

## Install GOV.UK Docker

[Install GOV.UK Docker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md). Make sure that you allocate at least the minimum resources specified in the [GOV.UK Docker settings guidance](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md#docker-settings) as running the prototype on your local machine is resource-intensive.

## Clone repositories to local machine

To set up GOV.UK account manager, clone the following repositories (repos) to the `~/govuk` folder on your local machine:

- the [GOV.UK account manager prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-account-manager-prototype)
- the [GOV.UK attribute service prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-attribute-service-prototype)
- the [finder frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend) that contains the Brexit transition checker
- the [email alert API](https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api/)

You [create the `~/govuk` folder](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md#prerequisites) when you install GOV.UK Docker.

Check out the following branches on the different repos:

- `master` branch on the GOV.UK Docker repo
- `main` branch on the GOV.UK account manager prototype repo
- `main` branch on the GOV.UK attribute service prototype repo
- `master` branch on the Brexit transition checker repo

## Set up the docker image and database

In the command line, go to the `govuk/govuk-docker` repo folder and run the following commands:

- `make govuk-attribute-service-prototype`
- `make govuk-account-manager-prototype`
- `make finder-frontend`
- `make email-alert-api`

These commands set up a docker image, build the required system and gem dependencies, and set up the database.

## Prevent developers from deploying secrets

The Account Manager prototype uses the [Pre-Commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) and the [`detect-secrets`](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) plugin to prevent developers deploying secrets.

### Install Pre-Commit framework

If you are using the [Homebrew Package Manager](https://brew.sh/) or [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) on Mac, install Pre-Commit by running `brew install pre-commit` in the command line.

See [the Pre-Commit framework installation documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) for more instructions on how to install Pre-Commit.

You must have Python 3 installed for this to work. Running the `brew install` command will install Python 3 as well. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for other ways to install Python 3 if required.

### Install `detect-secrets`

The `detect-secrets` plugin to the Pre-Commit framework detects secrets within a codebase.

To alert developers when they attempt to enter a secret in the codebase, [install the client-side pre-commit hook](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets#client-side-pre-commit-hook).

## Start the Brexit transition checker and account manager prototype apps

In the command line, go to the `finder-frontend` repo folder and run `govuk-docker-up`. This starts the `finder-frontend` Brexit transition checker and its dependencies.

Open up a web browser and go to `https://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk`.

If you have set up the apps correctly, you will be able to access the following links:

- the [Brexit transition checker journey start page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/questions)
- the [Brexit transition checker results page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/results?c[]=living-ie) that reflects the answers you give during the Brexit transition checker journey
- select the subscribe banner or button to access the [account sign up page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/save-your-results?c%5B%5D=living-ie)

When you have set up your local account, you can [sign into your account](http://www.login.service.dev.gov.uk/) and view the manage screens.

You have now set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype, and integrated the `finder-frontend` Brexit transition checker with the GOV.UK account manager.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues setting up and running the GOV.UK account manager prototype, it might be because:

- you have not allocated enough resources to GOV.UK Docker
- there have been backend changes to the database or the prototypes
- there have been [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) configuration changes to the app

### Not enough resources allocated to GOV.UK Docker

To change the resource allocation for GOV.UK Docker, see the [GOV.UK Docker settings guidance](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md#docker-settings).

### Backend changes to the database or the prototypes

To account for recent backend changes, go to the main branch of your local GOV.UK Docker repo and run the following in the command line:

```
govuk-docker run govuk-account-manager-prototype-lite bundle exec rake db:migrate
govuk-docker run govuk-account-manager-prototype-lite bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

Then [restart the Brexit transition checker and account manager prototype apps](#start-the-transition-checker-and-account-manager-prototype-apps).

### Ruby on Rails configuration changes to the app

If there have been Ruby on Rails configuration changes to the app, you must restart the app to see these changes reflected.

1. Run `govuk-docker down` in the command line to stop all GOV.UK Docker containers.
1. Run `govuk-docker-up` in the folder of the app you want to run to restart the GOV.UK Docker containers.

## Sending emails locally

You'll need to pass a GOV.UK Notify API key as an environment variable
`NOTIFY_API_KEY`, and change the delivery method in [development.rb][]:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :notify
```

You'll also need to set a `GOVUK_NOTIFY_TEMPLATE_ID`, which might involve
creating a template in Notify if [your Notify service][] doesn't have one.

The template should have a Message of `((body))` only.

[development.rb]: config/environments/development.rb
[your Notify service]: https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/accounts

## Running the tests

You don't need govuk-accounts-docker to run the tests, a local postgres database is enough:

```
docker run --rm -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=db -p 5432:5432 postgres:13
```

Set up your environment and create the database tables:

```
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1/db"
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

Then you can run the tests with:

```
bundle exec rake
```

## Deployment to GOV.UK via concourse

Every commit to main is deployed to GOV.UK PaaS by [this concourse pipeline](https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering/teams/govuk-tools/pipelines/govuk-account-manager-prototype), which is configured in [concourse/pipeline.yml](/concourse/pipeline.yml).

You will need to be logged into the GDS VPN to access concourse.

The concourse pipeline has credentials for the govuk-accounts-developers user in GOV.UK PaaS. This user has the SpaceDeveloper role, so it can `cf push` the application.

## Secrets

Secrets are defined via the [gds-cli](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli) and Concourse secrets manager.

You can view live secrets with an authenticated cloud foundry command:
`cf env govuk-account-manager`.

Adding or updating a secret can be done with Concourse secrets manager and the [GDS cli](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#3-install-gds-tooling).

```
gds cd secrets add cd-govuk-tools govuk-account-manager-prototype/SECRET_NAME your_secret_value
```

To remove a secret:

```
gds cd secrets rm cd-govuk-tools govuk-account-manager-prototype/SECRET_NAME
```

You would also need to unset it from the PaaS environment. Which you can do with this command:

```
cf unset-env govuk-account-manager SECRET_NAME
```

## Creating a new OAuth application

First get a Rails console.  For example, when running locally in Docker Compose:

```
docker ps
docker exec -it ${container_id} rails console
```

Then create a new `Doorkeeper::Application`:

```
a = Doorkeeper::Application.create!(name: "...", redirect_uri: "...", scopes: [...])
puts "client id:     #{a.uid}"
puts "client secret: #{a.secret}"
```

You will probably want `openid` in the list of scopes.

## Disabling registrations

Set the `ENABLE_REGISTRATION` environment variable to `false` to
disable the registration form.

To do this in production / staging:

1. Edit `concourse/pipeline.yml`, changing `ENABLE_REGISTRATION: "true"` to  `ENABLE_REGISTRATION: "false"` in the relevant environment
2. Deploy the pipeline change (happens automatically on push to main)
3. Deploy the application (happens automatically on push to main)

If changing the pipeline isn't feasible (for example, you are doing
this out-of-hours and nobody else is around), you can use the PaaS CLI
to set the environment variable:

1. Log into the PaaS
2. `cf set-env govuk-account-manager ENABLE_REGISTRATION false`
3. `cf restage govuk-account-manager`

This approach will cause some brief downtime as the app restarts, and
the environment variable change will be lost on the next Concourse
deployment.

## Exporting registration statistics

We may periodically be asked to produce reports with information about the
number of registrations, logins, etc. There is a rake task to handle this and
has to be run manually in production, e.g. to produce statistics for the 28th
October 2020:

```
cf login -u <your_email> -a https://api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso
cf target -s production
cf v3-ssh govuk-account-manager
$ /tmp/lifecycle/shell
$ rake "statistics:general[2020-10-28 00:00, 2020-10-28 23:59]"
```

## Starting an A/B test

A/B testing works similarly as on GOV.UK, but with two exceptions:

- We don't use Fastly, so the variant selection and persistence logic
  is done in the app.
- If a user is logged in, we persist the selected variant in their
  account, regardless of device.

Before starting an A/B test you'll need:

- A custom dimension for Google Analytics from a performance analyst.
- A migration creating a field `ab_test_<testname>` on the user model.

Here's an example of a controller with an A/B test:

```ruby
# app/controllers/party_controller.rb
class PartyController < ApplicationController
  def show
    ab_test = AbTest.new(
      "your_ab_test_name",
      dimension: 300,
      expires: 1.week,
      allowed_variants: { NoChange: 1, LongTitle : 2, ShortTitle: 2 },
      control_variant: "NoChange"
    )
    @requested_variant = ab_test.requested_variant(request, cookies, current_user)
    @requested_variant.configure_response(response, cookies)

    case true
    when @requested_variant.variant?("LongTitle")
      render "show_template_with_long_title"
    when @requested_variant.variant?("ShortTitle")
      render "show_template_with_short_title"
    else
      render "show"
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, we are running a multivariate test with 3 options
being tested: the existing version (control) being shown 1/5th of the
time, and two changes each being shown 2/5ths of the time.  The
minimum number of variants in any test should be two.

When first switching on this A/B test, make sure to also deploy a
migration:

```ruby
# db/migrations/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx_start_ab_test_your_test_name.rb
class StartAbTestYourTestName < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :ab_test_your_ab_test_name, :string
  end
end
```

Then, add this to your layouts, so that we have a meta tag that can be
picked up by analytics:

```html
<!-- application.html.erb -->
<head>
  <%= @requested_variant.analytics_meta_tag.html_safe %>
</head>
```

When switching off an A/B test, first remove the test from the
controller and view, then deploy a migration removing the field from
the users model:

```ruby
# db/migrations/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx_stop_ab_test_your_test_name.rb
class StopAbTestYourTestName < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    remove_column :users, :ab_test_your_ab_test_name
  end
end
```

See [the govuk_ab_testing README][] for full documentation on usage
and testing.
